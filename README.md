## What is Python?

**Python** is a popular programming language. It was created by **Guido van Rossum**, and released in **1991**.

It is used for:

- Web Development (Server-side)
- Software Development
- Mathematics
- System Scripting

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Good to know

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
- In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages

- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

## Python Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

### Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them:

```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```python
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```python
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

### Multiline Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a `#` for each line:

```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
